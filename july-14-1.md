## PROBLEM

> Question 1.10: Picture a 10 × 10 × 10 “macro-cube” floating in mid-air. The macro-cube is composed of 1×1×1 “micro-cubes,” all glued together. Weather damage causes the outermost layer of micro-cubes to become loose. This outermost layer falls to the ground. How many micro-cubes are on the ground?

## SOLUTION

* the problem is simple, since the micro-cubes are 1\*1\*1, it can be seen as the unit of the macro-cube
* the outer layer falls ---> the length, the width, and the height of the micro-cube decrease by 2, now the macro-cube becomes 8\*8\*8.
* thus, the volume is: 10^3 - 8^3 = 488.
