## PROBLEM

> How many degrees (if any) are there in the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock when the time is a quarter past three?
>
>
>
> What is the first time after 3pm when the hour and minute hands of a clock are exactly on top of each other?



## SOLUTION

* we can easily determine the relationship between the speed of the hour and minute hands (in degrees):
* hour hand: (360 / 12) / 60 = 0.5 degree per min
* minute hand: 360 / 60 = 6 degree per min
* when the time is a quarter past three:
* hour hand (in degrees): 90 + 0.5 \* 15 = 97.5
* minute hand (in degrees): 15\*6 = 90
* their difference: 7.5



* We can generalize the formula for solving the second problem:
* let's time after 3 pm be t
* 90+0.5t = 6t
* t = 90 / 5.5
