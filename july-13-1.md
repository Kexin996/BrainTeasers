## PROBLEM

> “You are a bug sitting in one corner of a cubic room. You wish to walk (no flying) to the extreme opposite corner (the one farthest from you). Describe the shortest path that you can walk. Be sure to mention direction, length, and so on.”

## SOLUTION

* normally, if we need to find the shortest distance between 2 points in a 3D world, we need to find the "straight line" in this object
* e.g., in a sphere, the shortest distance will be on its diameter
* No curve ---> we only have straight line
* sqrt(2^2+1^2)= sqrt(5)
