## PROBLEM

> Suppose I inscribe a circle within a square so that the circle just touches the four sides of the square. Suppose there is exactly enough room to fit a rectangle of dimensions 5 Ã— 10 into one corner of the square so that the rectangle just touches the circle. See Figure 1.1. What is the side length of the square?

## SOLUTION

* it is quite simple since we have already known that the radius of the circle must be half of the square
* set the radius to x, (x-10)^2 + (x-5)^2 = x^2
* solve it
