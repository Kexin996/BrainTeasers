## SOLUTION

* Note: the problem requires us to **describe the pieces**, meaning that the pieces cannot be similar to a slice of a pizza; it is **not regular**
* We know that the sum from 1 to 12 is: 78, and the numbers on each piece sums to the same
* 78 / 3 = 26, meaning that the sum of each piece should be 26
* We know that:
* 5+6+7+8 = 26, and 11+12+1+2 = 26, and the rest are discontinuous
* We know that the three pieces should be like:
